* Init file(and directory) Quick Access.

** Trivia
   Sadly, Emacs (unlike Spacemacs, which has `spacemacs/find-dotfile') doesn't have
   a function to open its own init file, so thousands of users have to write their owns.
   I'm not different :)

** Installation

   Using use-package:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package iqa
      :ensure nil
      :quelpa
      (iqa :repo "a13/iqa.el" :fetcher github :version original)
      :init
      (setq iqa-user-init-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org"))
      :config
      (iqa-setup-default))
   #+end_src

** Info

   ~iqa-find-user-init-file~ is a shorthand to open user init file.
   By default ~user-init-file~ is used.  If your configuration is generated
   from org-mode source you may want to point it to your org file.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq iqa-user-init-file (concat user-emacs-directory "init.org"))
   #+end_src

   File is opened by ~find-file~ but you can redefine it by e.g.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq iqa-find-file-function #'find-file-other-window)
   #+end_src

   ~iqa-find-user-init-directory~ opens init file directory

   ~iqa-setup-default~ binds "C-c f" to ~iqa-find-user-init-file~,
   "C-c d" to ~iqa-find-user-init-directory~
